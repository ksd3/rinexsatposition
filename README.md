# rinexsatposition
Vectorized Python implementation of Keplerian orbit propagator that gives satellite positions from RINEX navigation message files.

Has not been checked extensively for accuracy, but is accurate 'enough' for GPS satellites. (~within 1-2 degrees of lat/lon).

Not recommended for highly precise use.
